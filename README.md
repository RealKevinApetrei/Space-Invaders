# About the Project
## Information
![Oct-02-2020 20-09-38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65184258/94960718-3f414580-04eb-11eb-9109-e5c3d94e9a0d.gif)

This project is a basic Space Invaders game. It is not your usual space invaders, but, there are aliens coming down at **increasingly difficult** speeds. This was my first project using a library actually used to make games.

The game does not have a start menu or a proper ending. It does have a scoring system for each hit, there are also some effect and a background theme song.

- Colourful Background
- 1 Type of Enemy Spaceship
