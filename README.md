This project is a basic Space Invaders game. It is not your usual space invaders, but, there are aliens coming down at **increasingly difficult** speeds. This was my first project using a library actually used to make games.

The game does not have a start menu or a proper ending. It does have a scoring system for each hit, there are also some effect and a background theme song.
